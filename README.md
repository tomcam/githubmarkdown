# Using GitHub to manage Markdown projects

You can use GitHub for documentation. Write the files using [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/),
patch them together with a simple table of contents like this one, and use GitHub to publish your
documentation as a website.

This guide doesn't hide from things like using `git` on the command line, but it does try to hold
your hand every step of the way.

## Workflow

The typical workflow is something like this:

* Create a temporary working directory somewhere
* Clone the site off of GitHub into that directory
* Add, delete, or make changes to files in the project
* Note changes to those files through commit messages
* Upload the finished version back to GitHub

Repeat as necessary.

## Table of contents

### [Create and configure a repository](createrepo.md)

### [Clone the repository on your work machine](clone.md)

### [Reference](reference.md)

### [Questions](questions.md)

Things to resolve before announcing this project.
