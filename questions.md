# Questions that need answering before this project is released

## Can you create a GitHub repo from the command line?

The instructions on [creating a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) do not contain any
instructions for doing it through batch mode. Is it possible to create a repo using the command line? If so
are their any best practices on when to do which?

## Is there a way to move image files?

The way you "move" files in GitHub is to rename them. This doesn't work for image files that I can tell--or am I missing something? Right now all I know to do is to re-upload them.
