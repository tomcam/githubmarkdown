## Can you create a GitHub repo from the command line?

The instructions on [creating a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) do not contain any
instructions for doing it through batch mode. Is it possible to create a repo using the command line? If so
are their any best practices on when to do which?
