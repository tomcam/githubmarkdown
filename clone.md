# Clone the repository to your work machine

Now let's make a copy of the repository on your work machine.

* First, [install Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) if you haven't done so already.

On Macintosh systems, you may be required to download XCode if you haven't already. And before you download XCode, you need to create a free account with the Apple Developer Program.

* Follow those instructions and sign up as needed. 

Do not be distracted by what seems like a requirement to pay
for the account. That's only if you're going to list a product in the App Store.

* To ensure you have Git, open your terminal and enter `git` at the command line.

The result should be several pages of explanatory text looking something like this:

```
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone      Clone a repository into a new directory
```

That shows you Git has been installed. If you see something like this, it means you don't have Git yet:

```
-bash: git: command not found
```
