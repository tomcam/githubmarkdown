# Create and configure a repository

# MISSING: The github.io stuff so it uses Jekylll

* Log into GitHub (create an account if necessary).
* Look for the *+* at the top of the page. Click it, then choose `New repository`.

The `Create a new repository` page appears.

* Under `Repository name`, write a programmer-style name: short, all lower case, no spaces, and *-* between letters if necessary.

* Under `Description` write anything you want, but keep in mind it will be public and it should also feel inviting to the reader.

Leave `Public` set, because private ones usually cost money and besides that's not the typical use for this scenario.

* Check `Initialize the repository with a README.

* Choose something in the `Add a license` dropdown. MIT is popular but leaves you no exclusive rights the project,
but there are many other variables.

* Click `Create repository`.
